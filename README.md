# Replication Study: On Housing, Health and Happiness
In this blog post, we will be conducting a replication study of Matias D. Cattaneo et.al “Housing, Health, and Happiness” 2009. Matias D. Cattaneo and his peers study the health effects of the Piso Firme project, a government-subsidized “slum upgrade” involving the installation of cement floors in households near the Torreon region of Mexico.
